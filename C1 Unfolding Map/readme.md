# City map project 


The applet has the following extensions:



* Map providers are selected by keys:
  *Hot keys are used to change the map providers for different user preferences. I use Microsoftâ€™s aerial, road, and hybrid map providers (key1,2, and 3). Key c will clear and update the map.

* Statistical information display (from all the countries)
The statistical information of an earthquake (country and number of quakes), and sorted magnitude information (magnitude and location) can be alternatively displayed on the right hand side of the map. It will display two kinds of information on the right hand side of the map instead of printing them in the console. Key 4: show the country name, and the number of quakes in each country (up to 30). Key 5: display the location and magnitude information sorted by the magnitude in reverse order(up to 30). The right text box will be changed alternatively by clicking key 4 and 5.
* The statistical information of a city will be shown on the left hand side of the map when it is clicked on. 

* The map background is replaced by a jpg image, which is nicer. It sorts earthquakes in reverse order of magnitude (step3,4) and also prints them in the console.

4 City statistics when city marker is clicked on:
